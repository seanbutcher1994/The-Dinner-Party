## User story
* As a dinner party planner, I want an App that allows me to type in an ingredient and show a random recipe for a meal or a drink each time.
* The recipe should contain the name, an image, all required ingredients, and the preparing instruction of the meal or the drink, so I know what I can make with the ingredients I have, or what ingredients I will need to buy.
* I want to see the searched history for future use.
